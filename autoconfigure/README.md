# OpenTelemetry SDK Autoconfigure

This package is `Experimental` and subject to change/remove in the future

This artifact implements environment-based autoconfiguration of the OpenTelemetry SDK. This can be
an alternative to programmatic configuration using the normal SDK.

All options support being passed as environment variables, e.g., `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp`.

```golang
// export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=otlplogs-example
// export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
// export OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=otlp,logging
// export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="key1=value1,key2=value2"

package main

import (
	"os"
	"context"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource"
	semconv "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.20.0"
	autosdk "github.com/agoda-com/opentelemetry-logs-go/autoconfigure/sdk/logs"
)

func main() {

	// It is possible to mix with explicit configuration
	host, _ := os.Hostname()
	attrs := resource.NewWithAttributes(
		semconv.HostName(host),
	)

	ctx := context.Background()
	loggerProvider := autosdk.NewLoggerProvider(ctx, autosdk.WithResource(attrs))
	defer func() {
		loggerProvider.Shutdown(ctx)
	}()
}

```

## General configuration

### Exporters

The following configuration properties are common to all exporters:

| Environment variable | Purpose                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER   | List of exporters to be used for logging, separated by commas. Default is `otlp`. `none` means no autoconfigured exporter. |

#### OTLP exporter (log exporters)

The [OpenTelemetry Protocol Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md)
span, metric, and log exporters

| Environment variable                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

To configure the service name for the OTLP exporter, add the `service.name` key
to the OpenTelemetry Resource ([see below](#opentelemetry-resource)),
e.g. `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=myservice`.

##### OTLP exporter retry

[OTLP](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md#otlpgrpc-response)
requires
that [transient](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/exporter.md#retry)
errors be handled with a retry strategy. When retry is enabled, retryable gRPC status codes will be retried using an
exponential backoff with jitter algorithm as described in
the [gRPC Retry Design](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A6-client-retries.md#exponential-backoff).

The policy has the following configuration, which there is currently no way to customize.

- `maxAttempts`: The maximum number of attempts, including the original request. Defaults to `5`.
- `initialBackoff`: The initial backoff duration. Defaults to `1s`
- `maxBackoff`: The maximum backoff duration. Defaults to `5s`.
- `backoffMultiplier` THe backoff multiplier. Defaults to `1.5`.

#### Logging exporter

The logging exporter prints the name of the span along with its attributes to stdout. It's mainly used for testing and
debugging.

| Environment variable       | Description                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=logging | Select the logging exporter for logs |

### OpenTelemetry Resource

The [OpenTelemetry Resource](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/resource/sdk.md)
is a representation of the entity producing telemetry.

| Environment variable     | Description                                                                                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES | Specify resource attributes in the following format: key1=val1,key2=val2,key3=val3                         |
| OTEL_SERVICE_NAME        | Specify logical service name. Takes precedence over `service.name` defined with `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` |

You almost always want to specify
the [`service.name`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/resource/semantic_conventions#service)
for your application.
It corresponds to how you describe the application, for example `authservice` could be an application that authenticates
requests, and `cats` could be an application that returns information about [cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat).
You would specify that by setting service name property in one of the following ways:

* directly via `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=authservice`
* by `service.name` resource attribute like `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=authservice`,

If not specified, SDK defaults the service name to `unknown_service:path_to_class`.

### Attribute limits

These properties can be used to control the maximum number and length of attributes.

| Environment variable              | Description                                                           |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OTEL_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT | The maximum length of attribute values. By default there is no limit. |
| OTEL_ATTRIBUTE_COUNT_LIMIT        | The maximum number of attributes. Default is `128`.                   |

## Logger provider

The following configuration options are specific to SDK `LoggerProvider`.
See [general configuration](#general-configuration) for general configuration.

## Batch log record processor

| Environment variable            | Description                                                                        |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OTEL_BLRP_SCHEDULE_DELAY        | The interval, in milliseconds, between two consecutive exports. Default is `1000`. |
| OTEL_BLRP_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE        | The maximum queue size. Default is `2048`.                                         |
| OTEL_BLRP_MAX_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE | The maximum batch size. Default is `512`.                                          |
| OTEL_BLRP_EXPORT_TIMEOUT        | The maximum allowed time, in milliseconds, to export data. Default is `30000`.     |

## Customizing the OpenTelemetry SDK

Autoconfiguration currently doesn't expose any methods for customization. Only default `otlp` and `logging` providers
can be configured. This is subject to improve in the future
